## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- building this project i learned how to switch div position using the order property, i also 
learned how to add a color filter on top of an image. 


### Continued development

My next projects will be building a couple of full static websites so i can continue to improve my css skills in flexbox, animation, pseudo elements and classes and so on.


### Useful resources

- Youtube: watched a couple of videos on flexbox order property helped me understand it better 
and how to use it. 

- MDN web docs: has a ton of information and found lots of answers on there
